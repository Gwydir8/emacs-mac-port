1. What's this?

   This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 23 by Yamamoto Mitsuharu. This
   provides a native GUI support for Mac OS X 10.2 - 10.6.  Note that Emacs 23
   already contains the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for Mac
   OS X 10.4 and later.  So if it is good enough for you, then you don't need
   to try this.

   More about this fork, please read README-mac.

2. How to install 

   1). build a self-contained Emacs.app with build-emacs.app.sh
       Only test in Snow Leopard!

   2). if you are using Homebrew, copy "emacs-mac.rb" to your brew's
       formula directory(usually at /usr/local/Library/Formula/), and
       
       $ brew install emacs-mac

   3). i. Get the latest code from git repository

       	  if you are new here:
      	     $ git clone git://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port.git
      
	  if you cloned this repository before:
     	     $ git pull

       ii. Follow the step g. h. i. in "2. Build instructions" from README-mac

      	  You can SKIP step a. b. c. d. e. and f. because code in this
      	  repository was patched already.
