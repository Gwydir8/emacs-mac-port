1. What's this?

   This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 23. This provides a native GUI
support for Mac OS X 10.2 - 10.6.  Note that Emacs 23 already contains the
official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for Mac OS X 10.4 and later.  So
if it is good enough for you, then you don't need to try this.

   More about this fork, please read README-mac.
