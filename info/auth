1 Overview
**********

The auth-source library is simply a way for Emacs and Gnus, among
others, to answer the old burning question "What are my user name and
password?"

   (This is different from the old question about burning "Where is the
fire extinguisher, please?".)

   The auth-source library supports more than just the user name or the
password (known as the secret).

   Similarly, the auth-source library supports multiple storage backend,
currently either the classic "netrc" backend, examples of which you can
see later in this document, or the Secret Service API.  This is done
with EIEIO-based backends and you can write your own if you want.

2 Help for users
****************

"Netrc" files are a de facto standard.  They look like this:
     machine MYMACHINE login MYLOGINNAME password MYPASSWORD port MYPORT

   The `machine' is the server (either a DNS name or an IP address).
It's known as :HOST in `auth-source-search' queries.  You can also use
`host'.

   The `port' is the connection port or protocol.  It's known as :PORT
in `auth-source-search' queries.

   The `user' is the user name.  It's known as :USER in
`auth-source-search' queries.  You can also use `login' and `account'.

   Spaces are always OK as far as auth-source is concerned (but other
programs may not like them).  Just put the data in quotes, escaping
quotes as you'd expect with `\'.

   All these are optional.  You could just say (but we don't recommend
it, we're just showing that it's possible)

     password MYPASSWORD

   to use the same password everywhere.  Again, _DO NOT DO THIS_ or you
will be pwned as the kids say.

   "Netrc" files are usually called `.authinfo' or `.netrc'; nowadays
`.authinfo' seems to be more popular and the auth-source library
encourages this confusion by accepting both, as you'll see later.

   If you have problems with the search, set `auth-source-debug' to
`'trivia' and see what host, port, and user the library is checking in
the `*Messages*' buffer.  Ditto for any other problems, your first step
is always to see what's being checked.  The second step, of course, is
to write a blog entry about it and wait for the answer in the comments.

   You can customize the variable `auth-sources'.  The following may be
needed if you are using an older version of Emacs or if the auth-source
library is not loaded for some other reason.

     (require 'auth-source)             ;; probably not necessary
     (customize-variable 'auth-sources) ;; optional, do it once

 -- Variable: auth-sources
     The `auth-sources' variable tells the auth-source library where
     your netrc files or Secret Service API collection items live for a
     particular host and protocol.  While you can get fancy, the default
     and simplest configuration is:

          ;;; old default: required :host and :port, not needed anymore
          (setq auth-sources '((:source "~/.authinfo.gpg" :host t :port t)))
          ;;; mostly equivalent (see below about fallbacks) but shorter:
          (setq auth-sources '((:source "~/.authinfo.gpg")))
          ;;; even shorter and the _default_:
          (setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg" "~/.authinfo" "~/.netrc"))
          ;;; use the Secrets API LOGIN collection (*note Secret Service API::)
          (setq auth-sources '("secrets:Login"))

     By adding multiple entries to `auth-sources' with a particular
     host or protocol, you can have specific netrc files for that host
     or protocol.  Usually this is unnecessary but may make sense if
     you have shared netrc files or some other unusual setup (90% of
     Emacs users have unusual setups and the remaining 10% are _really_
     unusual).

     Here's a mixed example using two sources:

          (setq auth-sources '((:source (:secrets default) :host "myserver" :user "joe")
                               "~/.authinfo.gpg"))


   If you don't customize `auth-sources', you'll have to live with the
defaults: any host and any port are looked up in the netrc file
`~/.authinfo.gpg', which is a GnuPG encrypted file (*note GnuPG and
EasyPG Assistant Configuration::).

   If that fails, the unencrypted netrc files `~/.authinfo' and
`~/.netrc' will be used.

   The typical netrc line example is without a port.

     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password YOURPASSWORD

   This will match any authentication port.  Simple, right?  But what if
there's a SMTP server on port 433 of that machine that needs a
different password from the IMAP server?

     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password SMTPPASSWORD port 433
     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password GENERALPASSWORD

   For url-auth authentication (HTTP/HTTPS), you need to put this in
your netrc file:

     machine yourmachine.com:80 port http login testuser password testpass

   This will match any realm and authentication method (basic or digest)
over HTTP.  HTTPS is set up similarly.  If you want finer controls,
explore the url-auth source code and variables.

   For Tramp authentication, use:

     machine yourmachine.com port scp login testuser password testpass

   Note that the port denotes the Tramp connection method.  When you
don't use a port entry, you match any Tramp method, as explained
earlier.  Since Tramp has about 88 connection methods, this may be
necessary if you have an unusual (see earlier comment on those) setup.

The auth-source library lets you control logging output easily.

 -- Variable: auth-source-debug
     Set this variable to 'trivia to see lots of output in *Messages*,
     or set it to a function that behaves like `message' to do your own
     logging.

   The auth-source library only has a few functions for external use.

 -- Function: auth-source-search SPEC
     TODO: how to include docstring?


   Let's take a look at an example of using `auth-source-search' from
Gnus' `nnimap.el'.

     (defun nnimap-credentials (address ports)
       (let* ((auth-source-creation-prompts
               '((user  . "IMAP user at %h: ")
                 (secret . "IMAP password for %u@%h: ")))
              (found (nth 0 (auth-source-search :max 1
                                                :host address
                                                :port ports
                                                :require '(:user :secret)
                                                :create t))))
         (if found
             (list (plist-get found :user)
                   (let ((secret (plist-get found :secret)))
                     (if (functionp secret)
                         (funcall secret)
                       secret))
                   (plist-get found :save-function))
           nil)))

   This call requires the user and password (secret) to be in the
results.  It also requests that an entry be created if it doesn't exist
already.  While the created entry is being assembled, the shown prompts
will be used to interact with the user.  The caller can also pass data
in `auth-source-creation-defaults' to supply defaults for any of the
prompts.

   Note that the password needs to be evaluated if it's a function.
It's wrapped in a function to provide some security.

   Later, after a successful login, `nnimap.el' calls the
`:save-function' like so:

     (when (functionp (nth 2 credentials))
        (funcall (nth 2 credentials)))

   This will work whether the `:save-function' was provided or not.
`:save-function' will be provided only when a new entry was created, so
this effectively says "after a successful login, save the
authentication information we just used, if it was newly created."

   After the first time it's called, the `:save-function' will not run
again (but it will log something if you have set `auth-source-debug' to
`'trivia').  This is so it won't ask the same question again, which is
annoying.  This is so it won't ask the same question again, which is
annoying.  This is so it won't ask the same question again, which is
annoying.

   So the responsibility of the API user that specified `:create t' is
to call the `:save-function' if it's provided.

Appendix A GnuPG and EasyPG Assistant Configuration
***************************************************

If you don't customize `auth-sources', the auth-source library reads
`~/.authinfo.gpg', which is a GnuPG encrypted file.  Then it will check
`~/.authinfo' but it's not recommended to use such an unencrypted file.

   In Emacs 23 or later there is an option `auto-encryption-mode' to
automatically decrypt `*.gpg' files.  It is enabled by default.  If you
are using earlier versions of Emacs, you will need:

     (require 'epa-file)
     (epa-file-enable)

   If you want your GnuPG passwords to be cached, set up `gpg-agent' or
EasyPG Assistant (*note Caching Passphrases: (epa)Caching Passphrases.).

   To quick start, here are some questions:

  1. Do you use GnuPG version 2 instead of GnuPG version 1?

  2. Do you use symmetric encryption rather than public key encryption?

  3. Do you want to use gpg-agent?

   Here are configurations depending on your answers:

1     2     3     Configuration
Yes   Yes   Yes   Set up gpg-agent.
Yes   Yes   No    You can't, without gpg-agent.
Yes   No    Yes   Set up gpg-agent.
Yes   No    No    You can't, without gpg-agent.
No    Yes   Yes   Set up elisp passphrase cache.
No    Yes   No    Set up elisp passphrase cache.
No    No    Yes   Set up gpg-agent.
No    No    No    You can't, without gpg-agent.

   To set up gpg-agent, follow the instruction in GnuPG manual (*note
Invoking GPG-AGENT: (gnupg)Invoking GPG-AGENT.).

   To set up elisp passphrase cache, set
`epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption'.
